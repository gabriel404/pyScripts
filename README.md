<h1>hangman</h1>


Small HangMan game, it still isn't finished and I'll probably never finish it.


<h1>PingPong</h1>


PingPong made in Python using pyGame, it still lacks some functions such as Pause and a good AI. However, the part needed on pyGame is totally finished and i'll never finish this one aswell.
